#### Minor Breaking Changes

This release introduces a small structural update to how Inertia guidelines are organized.

**Previously**

```
.ai/inertia-ugarit/core.blade.php




































```
**Now merged into individual version guideline**

```
.ai/inertia-ugarit/2/core.blade.php
.ai/inertia-ugarit/1/core.blade.php




































```
Guidelines are now resolved using the following priority order:

| Priority | Source | Maintained By |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| 1st | `.ai/guidelines/` in the user project | Project developer |
| 2nd | `vendor/{pkg}/resources/boost/guidelines/` | Composer package maintainer |
| 2nd | `node_modules/{pkg}/resources/boost/guidelines/` | npm package maintainer |
| 3rd | Built-in Boost `.ai/` directory | Boost team |

Make sure you update to the latest version of all related packages to stay compatible.
